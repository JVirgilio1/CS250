How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories are an extreamly important aspect of development. They help draw conclusions from different users, and determine what features need to be fixed or added for the majority of user satisfaction. Creating user stories helps by putting recomendations to a list, without lenghtining a backlog.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Approach development with an agile approach, rather then a waterfall. Test the product frequently, and read through user input. I will incorporate frequent testing and Scrum meetings in my future development work.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means being open to communication, a good individual to work with, and open minded. It also requires you to test products, and incorporate user feedback.
